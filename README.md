# Part of Speech Tagging by Viterbi Algorithm
Contributors: Hankyu Jang and Pulkit Maloo

## Introduction
Whenever we are given a sentence of any language (English in this case), we would like to tag each word into it's respective tags of verb, adverb, noun, pronoun, etc.

This can be achieved by modelling a sequence based on the inputs. We have various options here, ranging from traditional bayesian techniques to state of the art Recurrent Neural Networks.

Here we explore the power of Hidden Markov Model and apply Viterbi algorithm to model the sequences.

Overall with Viterbi, we achieve 95% of accuracy.
